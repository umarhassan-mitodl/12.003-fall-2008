  the Coriolis Force. Examines the trajectories of dry ice pucks launched over the
  surface of a smooth, rotating parabola viewed from both inertial and rotating frames.
  Experiments are described which are designed to help us come to a deeper understanding
  of frames of reference and the Coriolis force.'

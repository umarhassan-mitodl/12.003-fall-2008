Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Multivariable Calculus (18.02) and Physics I: Classical Mechanics (8.01)

Description
-----------

12.003 is an undergraduate class designed to introduce students to the physics that govern the circulation of the ocean and atmosphere. The focus of the course is on the processes that control the climate of the planet.

Textbook
--------

Marshall, John, and R. Alan Plumb. _Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics: An Introductory Text_. Boston, MA: Elsevier Academic Press, 2007. ISBN: 9780125586917.

Other Reading and References
----------------------------

Hartmann, Dennis L. _Global Physical Climatology_. _International Geophysics Series._ Vol. 56. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1994. ISBN: 9780123285300.  
This book is recommended as supplementary reading. It should prove useful for both atmospheric and oceanic sections of the course, especially chapters 1-7 of the book, which cover most of the material we will be covering (though in some cases it treats the material differently, and at different depth).

For the atmosphere, detailed treatment of radiation, and simple and intelligible treatment of dynamics.

Good qualitative discussion of many of the topics we will cover in atmospheric science.

Grading
-------

The assessment will be in four parts (with weight toward final grade):

1.  Homework assignments will be handed out each week that reviews material covered in class. These will serve a multiple purpose: As a component of the teaching process, as an assessment of performance, and as a means of providing feedback to me. (35%; the two lowest marks will be given half-weight)
2.  Class participation. (5%)
3.  A mid-term test. (20%)
4.  A final, closed book, exam on all assessable course material. (40%)
